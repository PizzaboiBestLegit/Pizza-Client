Q: Why does my game crashes when loading up/doesn't load up at all?
A: Remove levelhead, though apparently some versions of Levelhead don't have that problem. Not having patcher also causes this problem.

Q: How does the mithril macro return work?
A: You need to click on every spot of the path with the mithril marker keybind (needs to be in order) to add a path. After doing that, run /aotvtest to see if it'll work.
   If it doesn't work because, you can reset it by typing in /aotvtest clear. If only the last one doesn't work, just use the keybind on the last spot so it'll get removed.
   However, this won't work for any other spot but the last one, since the order would be messed up then.

Q: How do i get into the discord
